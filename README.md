# Wave Software Development Challenge - Mackenzie Browne Submission

## Intro
A Bootstrap - React - Meteor - Mongo app.  Built from [a boilerplate](https://github.com/mackbrowne/beehive) I have been working on with a friend.

Wave interview challenge can be found [here](https://github.com/wvchallenges/se-challenge-payroll)

### Running the app

Install Meteor
```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

Navigate to the root of this project and run
```bash
meteor npm install
meteor
```

### Testing

To run jest unit tests, you need the current version of node

[Please download it here if you don't have it](https://nodejs.org/en/)

```bash
npm test
```

If you don't want to do this additional setup, I've included the coverage files.  You can view them by opening .coverage/index.html in the browser.


### Final Thoughts
This challenge gave me the opportunity to build something that actually shows the skills that I am proud of.  Thanks for that.
